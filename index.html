      <div class="window closed" data-title="WWHFile - Leaked Memo">
        <p>Zero Daily News received a copy of this leaked memo from the
          WWH:Files. We are in the process of authenticating it.
          However, this seems to corroborate the existence of PROJECT
          PECORA POSITION. </p>
        <p>We’ve known about the vault planned within Mount Rushmore for
          decades. However, the government claims the vault project was
          abandoned due to “costs”. We can now confirm the vault was
          completed. </p>
        <p>The real secret is what is it used for now and why don’t they
          want us to know. Review the leaked memo for yourself and
          decide.</p>

        <p>Zero Daily News discovered the groups and organizations
          funding their secret work. Follow the money. </p>
        <p>These groups fund the WWH:Files keeping the agents among us
          working. We encourage everyone to track down these companies,
          learn their cover stories, and help us find out how they are
          involved in the WWH:Files. </p>
        <p>What do they know? When did they know it? </p>

        <p>Zero Daily discovered a pattern in the WWH:Files. By tracking
          the agents among us we found they converge on Deadwood, SD
          once a year.</p>
        <p>Information found online seems to indicate they meet there
          yearly to discuss new tactics, techniques, and procedures
          regarding the work they do.</p>
        <p>We believe this may be an annual training meeting hidden in
          South Dakota.</p>
        <p>This year we will attempt to send our own operatives to
          observe this gathering.</p>
